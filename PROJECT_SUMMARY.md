# Used Car Website Project Summary

## Project Overview

This is a comprehensive used car purchase website built with PHP and MySQL. The site features user authentication, car listings, loan calculator functionality, and various user features like favorites and purchase tracking.

## Key Features Implemented

### Core Functionality
- User registration and login system with secure authentication
- Dynamic car inventory display with detailed vehicle information
- Loan calculator for financing options
- User favorites system for saved vehicles
- Purchase tracking for bought vehicles
- Responsive design with theme switching capabilities

### Database Structure
The MySQL database includes several tables:
- `users` - User account information and authentication
- `cars` - Vehicle inventory with detailed specifications
- `favorites` - User-saved vehicle preferences
- `purchase_history` - Track of user vehicle purchases
- `calculator_sessions` - Loan calculation data
- `admin_activity_log` - Administrative activity tracking
- `inquiries` - Customer contact form submissions
- `site_settings` - Website configuration data

## Issues Resolved

### Database Connection Problems
Initially, the website was experiencing 500 errors on key pages (cars, calculator, help) due to database connection issues. The main problem was incorrect database credentials in the configuration file. The username was pointing to a non-existent database user, which was fixed by updating the config.php file with the correct database credentials.

### File Path Issues
Several PHP files were using incorrect include paths. The cars.php, calculator.php, and help.php files were trying to include files using `../php/` paths, but the actual file structure required `php/` paths. This was resolved by updating all include statements to use the correct relative paths.

### Missing PHP Functions
The website relies on several custom PHP functions for security and functionality. All required functions were verified to exist in the appropriate files:
- `sanitizeInput()` and `sanitizeOutput()` for data security
- `verifyCSRFToken()` and `generateCSRFToken()` for form protection
- `isLoggedIn()` and `loginUser()` for authentication
- `getDatabaseConnection()` for database access

### Image Display Issues
The car listings were not displaying vehicle images properly. This was caused by mismatched file names between the database records and the actual image files uploaded to the server. The SQL file was updated to use consistent .jpg file extensions and match the actual uploaded image files.

### Navigation Consistency
Login and register pages were using static navigation menus that didn't match the rest of the website. These were updated to use the dynamic navigation system that includes all menu items like Locations, Market Trends, and Loan Calculator.

### Database Cleanup
The database contained duplicate car entries and vehicles without corresponding images. The SQL file was cleaned up to include only 14 vehicles that have proper image files, eliminating duplicates and ensuring all displayed vehicles have working images.

## Technical Implementation Details

### Security Measures
- CSRF token protection on all forms
- Input sanitization for XSS prevention
- Password hashing using PHP's password_hash()
- Session-based authentication with secure cookie handling

### Database Optimization
- Proper indexing on frequently queried fields
- Foreign key constraints for data integrity
- Prepared statements to prevent SQL injection

### User Experience Features
- Theme switching (default, dark, light modes)
- Responsive design for mobile devices
- Dynamic content based on user login status
- Real-time form validation

## Current Status

The website is now fully functional with:
- Working user authentication system
- Complete car inventory with proper images
- Functional loan calculator
