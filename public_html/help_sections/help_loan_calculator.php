    <h4>üßÆ Accessing the Loan Calculator</h4>

        <li>
            <div class="step-title">Navigate to the Calculator</div>

        <li>
            <div class="step-title">Access from Car Listings</div>
            <div class="step-description">
                You can also access the calculator directly from any car listing by clicking "Calculate Payment" - this will pre-fill the vehicle price.
            </div>
        </li>
    </ol>
    
    <h4>üìù Understanding the Calculator Fields</h4>
    
    <p>The loan calculator requires four key pieces of information:</p>
    
    <ol class="help-steps">
        <li>
            <div class="step-title">Vehicle Price</div>
            <div class="step-description">
                Enter the total price of the car you're considering. This should be the listed price before taxes and fees.
                <ul style="margin: 1rem 0; padding-left: 2rem;">
                    <li><strong>Range:</strong> $1,000 - $200,000</li>
                    <li><strong>Tip:</strong> Use the exact price from the car listing for accuracy</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </li>
        
        <li>
            <div class="step-title">Down Payment</div>
            <div class="step-description">
                Enter how much you plan to pay upfront. A larger down payment reduces your monthly payment and total interest.
                <ul style="margin: 1rem 0; padding-left: 2rem;">
                    <li><strong>Typical Range:</strong> 10% - 25% of vehicle price</li>

            <div class="step-description">
                Choose how many years you want to finance the vehicle. Longer terms mean lower monthly payments but more total interest.

                    <li><strong>Short Term (2-3 years):</strong> Higher monthly payments, less total interest</li>
                    <li><strong>Medium Term (4-5 years):</strong> Balanced payments and interest</li>
