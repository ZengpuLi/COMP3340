## Video Guidelines

### File Formats

- **Aspect Ratio:** 16:9
- **File Size:** Keep under 50MB for web optimization

### Responsive Considerations
- Videos should include poster images for faster loading
- Multiple resolution options for different devices
- Fallback content for browsers that don't support video

### Accessibility
- Include captions/subtitles when possible
- Provide video descriptions for screen readers
- Ensure controls are keyboard accessible

## Implementation
Videos are integrated using HTML5 video elements with fallbacks to YouTube embeds where appropriate.
